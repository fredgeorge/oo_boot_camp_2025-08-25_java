# OO Boot Camp template for class exercises in Java

Java is relatively easy to set up with IntelliJ IDEA. 
Gradle is used for building and testing the project, and is a 
prerequisite. Install if necessary.
The following instructions are for installing the code 
in IntelliJ by JetBrains. 
Adapt as necessary for your environment.

Note: This implementation was set up to use:

- IntelliJ 2025.1.3 (Ultimate Edition)
- Java SDK 21 LTS (Oracle)
- Gradle 8.14.3
- JUnit 5.13.3 for testing

Open the reference code:

- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
    - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open" (it's a Gradle project)
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such,
with test directories in green.

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and the necessary libraries exist).
There should be errors in RectangleTest. 
Fixing them is the first exercise!
